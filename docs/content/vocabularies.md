# Vocabularies

Vocabularies are a collection of published RDF metadata Classes and Properties for describing a Resource. In some cases, these vocabularies are referred to as ontologies. They exist and are created externally to Omeka, and can be imported (with some limitations) into Omeka S for use throughout the Installation. The most-used Vocabulary is Dublin Core Terms (dcterms:). 

It is important to distinguish Linked Data Vocabularies from controlled vocabularies or authority files, which consist of terms and concepts, rather than Classes and Properties. In Omeka S, Controlled Vocabularies can be managed using the Value Suggest and Custom Vocab modules. 

Global and Site Administrators can manage their installationâ€™s vocabularies from the *Vocabularies* tab on the left hand navigation of the Admin Dashboard. OmekaS comes pre-loaded with the following vocabularies: [Dublin Core](http://purl.org/dc/terms/){target=_blank}; [Dublin Core Type](http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/){target=_blank}; [Bibliographic Ontology](https://bibliontology.com/){target=_blank}; and [Friend of a Friend](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/){target=_blank}. 

This [screencast](https://vimeo.com/449764902){target=_blank} walks through managing and adding vocabularies.

## Managing vocabularies
The main view of the *Vocabularies* tab in the Admin Dashboard displays the existing vocabularies for the Omeka S install. 

![Main view of vocabularies, with columns for label, prefix, classes, and properties counts and information](contentfiles/vocabularies.png)

Vocabularies are displayed in a table with headings for *Label* (name of vocabulary), *Prefix* (used by the database), *Classes* (number of classes in the vocabulary), and *Properties* (number of properties in the vocabulary). You can sort vocabularies by these columns using the up and down arrows at the right end of each column. 

You can use the icons at the right of the Label field to manage individual vocabularies. The edit icon (pencil) takes you to the edit page for that vocabulary, the delete icon (trash can) opens a sidebar to delete the vocabulary, and the details icon (ellipsis) opens a sidebar with information about the vocabulary.

When editing a vocabulary, you can make changes to the *label* and add *comments*. 

## Adding a vocabulary
New vocabularies must be imported from an existing metadata standard source. In order to import a new vocabulary, you must have a vocabulary file or a stable link to a vocabulary.

The New vocabulary page has three sections: Basic Info, File, and Advanced. 

Note that you may have to research in order to find the prefix, namespace uri, and label for the vocabulary, as these are not standardized. In addition to the vocabulary's website, you might consult <https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs>{target=_blank}.

After you have imported a vocabulary, you can use the Edit function to modify the vocabulary's Label and Comment, and to upload an updated vocabulary RDF file. 

### Basic info
This section contains the basic information for the vocabulary

- Label (required): the display name for the vocabulary in lists (e.g., "Dublin Core," "Friend of a Friend").
- Comment: any comments you have. 
- Namespace URI (required): this should be provided by the vocabulary.
- Namespace prefix (required): This will display before the property, indicating which vocabulary (e.g., the prefix for Dublin Core is dcterms).

### File
This section deals with the file for the vocabulary.

- Vocabulary file: Upload a file from your computer **or**
- Vocabulary URL: Enter the vocabulary's URL here. 
- File format: a dropdown, select from:
	- Autodetect
	- JSON-LD (.jsonld)
	- N-Triples (.nt)
	- Notation3 (.n3)
	- RDF/XML (.rdf)
	- Turtle (.ttl).

### Advanced

This section has advanced vocabulary settings.

- Language: Enter the preferred language of the labels and comments using an IETF language tag. 
- Label property: if this vocabulary uses an unconventional property for labels, enter the full property URI in angle brackets (`<`, `>`)in this field.
- Comment property: if you are using the above label property, enter the corresponding property URI in angle brackets (`<`, `>`) in this field.

## Editing a vocabulary
You can edit existing vocabularies by clicking the edit button (pencil icon) on the table of vocabularies.

You can also update the vocabulary by either uploading a new vocabulary file or entering the vocabulary URL and saving changes. You will be able to review any changes when updating a vocabulary.
If you decide you do not wish to save your changes, or click on the Edit button by mistake, you can click the Cancel button next to the Save button.

### Vocabulary import
Omeka S will import properly formatted vocabularies/ontologies. `rdfs:Class` and `rdfs:Property` data will be available. 

For Web Ontology Language (OWL) data, Omeka S will store only the RDF/S super-Properties and -Classes. Omeka S does not enforce any declaration or inferencing rules from OWL. Thus, for example, an `owl:Class` is treated in Omeka S like an `rdfs:Class`.

Similarly, the following are all treated only as `rdfs:Property`. OWL domains and ranges are also not enforced or stored:

* `owl:ObjectProperty`
* `owl:DatatypeProperty`
* `owl:SymmetricProperty`
* `owl:TransitiveProperty`
* `owl:FunctionalProperty`
* `owl:ObjectProperty`
* `owl:DatatypeProperty`
* `owl:SymmetricProperty`
* `owl:TransitiveProperty`
* `owl:FunctionalProperty`
* `owl:InverseFunctionalProperty`

For example, an imported ontology with an `owl:ObjectProperty` is not restricted to having objects that are URIs: Omeka S will accept a Literal value without complaint.

It is up to the person entering metadata to adhere to the standards as best they can.

## Deleting a vocabulary
With the exception of Dublin Core and Dublin Core Type, you can delete any vocabulary from your Omeka S installation, either from the Vocabulary browse or the Vocabulary edit page. 

From the Vocabulary browse page, click the trash can/delete icon in the row for the vocabulary you want to delete (labelled as 1 in the image below). A drawer will open on the right side of the browser asking you to confirm that you want to delete the vocabulary (labelled as 2 in the image below). To delete, click the *Confirm delete* button, and to cancel, simply close the drawer.

From the Edit Vocabulary page, you can click the large red *Delete* button in the upper right-hand corner of the page. This will open a drawer which will ask you to confirm the deletion. To delete, click the *Confirm delete* button, or to cancel, simply close the drawer.
