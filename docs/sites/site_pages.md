# Site Pages

Pages form the content of your [sites](../sites/index.md). A site can have one or many pages, and these pages can be [organized, using Navigation](site_navigation.md), into a linear storyline (such as for virtual exhibits) or in a more hierarchical way (such as into chapters). 

Manage the pages for a site by navigating to the Sites section on the left-hand navigation of the admin dashboard. Select the site for which you want to manage the pages and click either the title or the edit (pencil) button to edit that site. 

Once you are editing the site, click the Pages link in the left-hand navigation.

When you create a new site, Omeka S automatically adds a page titled "Welcome" with a single HTML block (see below). You can edit this page or delete it.

## Browse pages
The Pages tab will display all of your pages in their navigation order. Child pages will display below the parent page with one or more `-` (dash) characters before the page title.

Every page is listed with its Title, buttons to view (box with an arrow coming out), edit (pencil), or delete (trash can) the page, the page's slug, and its last-modified date. 

![A sites page browse view, with pages listed, some of which are child pages of the others.](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_browse.png)

Use the [Navigation](site_navigation.md) screen of the site to set the order of pages, including setting child and parent pages.

## Add a page
From the site you are working on, click the Pages link in the left-hand sidebar. Then click the "Add new page" button on the upper right corner of the window.

To add a page you must enter a **Title**. You can also enter a **URL slug**. Both of these can be edited later. A title is required to create the page. If you do not enter a slug, Omeka S will create one from the page title. A slug is the pageâ€™s portion of the URL and can only contain letters, numbers, and hyphens; no other characters are allowed.

In addition, there is a checkbox for "Add to navigation". If checked, the page will automatically be added to the end of the main [navigation](../sites/site_navigation.md) for the site, at the top level. If you do not check this box, you can manually add the page to the site navigation and arrange it from the Navigation page.

![Page view showing the fields for Add Page](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_add.png)

The eye icon, to the left of the "Cancel" and "Add" buttons, is a toggle to set the visibility of your page. If the toggle is set to public (no line), then anyone can see the page. If the toggle is set to private (line through the eye icon), the page will only be visible to logged-in users of the Omeka S installation who have site permissions (Supervisors and Global Admins will always be able to see private pages). This will include its appearance in the navigation. Pages are visible by default. 

Clicking or hitting enter on the eye icon toggles between public and private. 

Page is public: ![make public button showing an eye icon](../content/contentfiles/item_public.png){style="display:inline;"}

Page is private: ![make private button showing an eye icon with a diagonal slash through it](../content/contentfiles/item_private.png){style="display:inline;"}

Once you have entered this information, click the "Add" button in the upper right hand corner of the browser window. You will be automatically taken to that page's edit view (see below). 

If you decide you do not want to create the page, click the "Cancel" button.

## Edit a page  
After clicking the Pages link, select the page you wish to edit by clicking the name of the page or the edit button (pencil).

![A page in edit view, with a page title, a media block, and an HTML block.](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_edit.png)

The edit view for a page will display the page's title across the top. In the upper right is the public/private toggle (the eye icon), and buttons to view the public version (in a new tab), delete the page, cancel changes, or save changes. Changes will not display on the public side of your site until after they have been saved.

At the top of the work area are fields for the page title and URL slug. You can edit these at any time, but remember that the slug must be unique within the site (e.g. you cannot have two pages with the slug "welcome" on the same site).

### From the public side
If you are on the admin side and click "View" in the upper right-hand corner of a page, it will take you to the public view for that page. 

As you are browsing the public side of your site, you can edit the page you are viewing if you are currently logged in and the [user bar option is turned on in Site Settings](../sites/site_settings.md#general-settings). 

The user bar, which appears across the top of the page, includes a link to edit the current page - circled in red in the below image. 

![User bar for a page from the site Jane Austen, with "Edit page" circled in red](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_edit_public.png)

We recommend keeping a tab open to the public page and refreshing it to check the results of your changes. Remember to look at your page at different browser heights and widths to ensure objects flow and wrap as intended. You may also wish to check the display of your page on a mobile device. 

### Layout mode
There are two options for laying out the blocks that include a page's content: **Normal flow** and **Grid**. 

**Normal flow** provides a view where the blocks stack one upon the next to build the page. With this layout, you can set blocks to float right and left, take up the full width, or center the content in the full width. When blocks (such as media) are floated alongside an HTML block, the text will flow and wrap around the floated block. Floated blocks take up a maximum of one-third of the page's total width. 

**Grid** is a user-defined column system, based on [the CSS Grid layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout){target=_blank}, that allows the user to finely-tune the placement and width of the blocks in a page. With this choice you can define the number of columns you want to work with in your page, from 1 to 12; blocks can be set to occupy one or more of the columns, next to each other in rows. 

#### Configuration
Next you will have the option to apply configuration settings to the entire page. Clicking on the gear icon will open the Page layout configuration menu. 

In **Normal flow**, you will be able to select a template for the page if the site theme provides one.

In **Grid**, you will see two buttons:

- The Preview Layout button will preview the layout in the right-hand drawer. This will show you all the blocks currently on the page and their width in terms of the columns on the page. It will also show block groups with an extra outline around the group's contents. 
- The Configure Layout button (gear icon) will allow you to select a template for the page, and define the gaps (in pixels) between the columns and rows of blocks.
- If you make a mistake in your grid page layout settings, you can reset the page to the most recently saved version by clicking the "Restore" button that appears to the right of these buttons.

Once you have made your layout choices, you are ready to add blocks to the page.

### Add blocks

On the right-hand side you can choose to add a new block to your page by selecting one of the following elements:

- Asset
- Browse preview
- HTML
- Item with metadata
- Line break
- List of pages
- List of sites
- Media embed
- oEmbed
- Page date/time
- Page title
- Table of contents.

If you have the relevant modules installed, you may also have the following page blocks:

- [Collecting](../modules/collecting.md)
- [Data visualization](../modules/datavisualization.md)
- [Item Carousel](../modules/itemcarouselblock.md)
- [Map by attachments](../modules/mapping.md)
- [Map by query](../modules/mapping.md).

Some blocks come with default configurations to make setup and previewing easy. For example, the page date/time block automatically is set to show the medium-detail version of both created and modified dates. 

Other blocks require manual settings immediately when adding them to the page. For example, you cannot add an oEmbed block without entering a URL immediately; you cannot save the page with this field blank. 

See a detailed explanation of each block in the [Page blocks](#page-blocks) section.

#### Block groups

New in Omeka S 4.1, you can now group page blocks together. This allows you to assign layout settings to the group, which will behave like a normal block in the layout of the page. Block groups can be styled like blocks, below, with a background color or image that spans around all of its contents, and with classes, internal padding, and alignments. 

At the top of the right-hand drawer, next to the "Add new block" title, you will see a white button that says "Add block group". 

When a group is added to a page, you can drag and drop blocks inside it. You can then drag the block group around like any other block. To remove a block from a group, you can simply drag it out, or delete it. Deleting a block group will delete all of its contents. 

### Block settings

In the Normal flow or Grid layout, you can configure each block with the gear icon that shows in its title bar. This will deploy the Block layout configuration menu in the right-hand drawer, which contains the following options:

**Template**: If your theme provides one, you can select a template to apply to the block from the dropdown menu. For example, the Foundation theme allows you to set the Browse preview block to its own list or grid display, ignoring the settings of the site itself. Not every page block will have available templates. 

**Class** allows you to type in a specific class to apply styles to the block. 

**Alignment** includes two settings: Block alignment and Text alignment. 

Block alignment has different options whether you are using [Grid](#grid) or [Normal flow](#normal-flow) layout. See the sections below for more details. 

The text alignment can be:

- Default
- Left
- Center
- Right 
- Justified (full).

Text alignment will affect the contents of the block, including images, text, and links. For example, you can have a block floated to the left of the page, with all of its text and images text-aligned right.

**Constraints** allows you to set a maximum width and/or a minimum height for the block. 

**Padding** allows you to enter numbers (in pixels) for the top, left, right, and bottom padding inside the block. You may wish to utilize this when setting a background image or color on an HTML block filled with text; the background will extend to the full width of the block, while padding can be used to keep text from touching the edges. 

**Background** allows you to select a background for the block: either a color ([using a hexadecimal or word value](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp){target=_blank}) or an image, from the assets available in the installation. 

If you choose an image, the three dropdown menus below will be useful: 

- The **Vertical** anchor position allows you to select [Default, Top, Center, or Bottom positioning for the background asset](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-position.php){target=_blank}.
- The **Horizontal** anchor position allows you to select Default, Left, Center or Right positioning for the background asset.
- **Size** allows you to you select [Default, Cover, or Contain for the background asset](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background-size.php){target=_blank}.

Once you have configured the block, click "Apply changes". You must save the block settings and then save the page settings in order to see your changes on the public side. 

#### Normal flow

![A normal-flow page being edited.](sitesfiles/sitepg_normalflow.png)

**Block alignment**, in **normal flow**, allows you to choose one of the four block positions: 

- Default
- Float Left
- Float Right
- Center. 

Floating blocks left or right will cause them to occupy a maximum of one-third of the page, and may be smaller, depending on the block's contents. For example, a Media embed block with a 200-pixel thumbnail and a short title or caption will only occupy 200 pixels plus padding. 

An HTML block positioned just underneath a floated block (i.e. the next object on the page) will occupy the rest of the width of the page, and will wrap around the floated block if applicable. This is true whether the floated block is floated left or right. 

A center-aligned block in normal flow will not allow floats on either side - it will take up the full width of the page. Only a default-aligned block will wrap around another block. 

![A normal-flow page on the public side, with two floated blocks and one HTML block.](sitesfiles/sitepg_normalPublicFloats.png)

The image above shows, in order: 

- A media embed block floated left, with default-aligned text,
- A media embed block floated right, with right-aligned text,
- An HTML block set to default alignment, wrapping around the media blocks, with justified text.

#### Grid

![A grid page being edited.](sitesfiles/sitepg_grid.png)

In Grid layout you can select the placement and width of each block based on the [number of columns you have set for the page](#configuration). 

- For each block, you can declare its starting "Position," meaning the column number where the block will begin. You can also set the position to "Auto", meaning it will start wherever there is space for it to fit. You will see the "Position" dropdown reflect the number of columns of your page, minus the "Span" of the block (its width). For example, a 6-column page with a block set to span 3 columns will be allowed to start in columns 1, 2, 3, or 4. 
	
- Each block has a "Span" setting that determines the width of the block. The dropdown will offer choices from "1" to the number of columns set for the page. If you select the maximum number of columns, this block will span the full width of the page; anything less will leave whitespace or allow space for another block to occupy the same row. 

Using these two settings, the blocks in your page will organize themselves into rows based on your selections. To fit two items in a row, set each to span a number that will add up to the number of columns on the page or less.

To see a schema of how your blocks are positioned on the page, click on the Layout preview button (an icon of blocks in a grid), which will reveal a mockup in the righthand drawer.

Note that each page block will have a width calculated as follows:
- First find the total width of the browser window alloted to page content - minus any sidebars, and with maximum widths determined by your theme. 
- Then divide that by the number of columns. For example, a 1200-pixel-width container divided by 4 columns will give 300 pixels each.
- Then account for the width of column gaps from the page settings (default is 10 pixels), and the number of gaps between blocks. For example, a 2-column block next to another 2-column block in a 4-column grid will be: 1200 pixels, minus 30 for all 3 of the column gaps, divided by 4 columns, times 2 for a 2-column block, plus 10 pixels to span across one of the gaps, for a final width of 595 pixels each.
- A block will calculate its width based on its own span setting, and take into account all potential column gaps, whether there is other content in the row or not. This keeps the grid layout neat on the front-end regardless of each row's contents.
- Keep in mind that the total available space will depend on the device used, and the size of the browser window. Omeka themes have fallbacks for narrow mobile widths, which may result in your page blocks displaying at one per row. 

You can also set the positioning of content within each block with the **Block alignment** dropdown, found under **Alignment**. 

In the **Grid** page layout, Block alignment offers you:

- Default
- Left
- Right
- Center.

This will determine the position of the block's contents inside its spans. A page title, for example, is set to span the full width of the page by default, but choosing left, right, or center alignment will move the content to the designated spot, constraining the container tightly around the content and leaving whitespace in the rest of the span. This is most visible when using a background color or image on blocks. 

![A grid page on the public side, with 4 page title blocks.](sitesfiles/sitepg_gridPublic.png)

The image above shows, in order:

- A page title block set to default alignment, span 4 (of 4 columns), position auto;
- A page title block set to center alignment, span 4, position auto;
- A page title block set to default alignment with centered text, span 4, position auto;
- A page title block set to default alignment, span 2, position 2. 

Note that the second page title is still spanning all 4 columns on the page and nothing can be positioned to either side of it. 

### Delete and reorder blocks
You can delete any of the blocks by clicking on the trash can icon located in the upper right corner of the block. 

![The "page title" block is marked for deletion and thus highlighted in red.](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_delblock.png)

Change the order of blocks by clicking on the three horizontal lines on the upper left corner of any block and then dragging and dropping it to the desired location.

## Page blocks

Page blocks are designed to offer an array of authoring tools for whatever kind of page you may be writing. Third-party and user-submitted modules may add other page blocks to the ones built and maintained by the Omeka team. 

### Asset
Include files that are not media attached to items (such as a logo or banner). Users may upload new assets or select from existing assets.

![Asset block with asset selection sidebar open, including an asset upload option and an asset selection option](sitesfiles/sitepg_asset_selection.png)

Once an asset is selected, the user has the option to include additional asset information:

- Page link: Select a page from within the site, so that the asset becomes a link to it. The selected page's title will also appear as a text link above or beside the asset.
- Alternative link title: If a page link is set above, you can control the text display here. If nothing is entered, the link will default to the page's title.
- Caption: Text that will be displayed below or near the asset, not linked.

![Asset options sidebar with inputs for page link, alternative link title, and caption](sitesfiles/sitepg_asset_sidebar.png)

Display of these elements will depend on the theme and any [template settings](#block-settings) that are applicable. 

Click "Apply changes" to set the asset information.

### Browse preview

Allows you to add a block of resources on a page, identically to the "Items" and other browse page included with your Omeka site.

![Browse Preview block with the query element](sitesfiles/sitepg_browsepreview_query.png)

From the **Resource type** dropdown, choose the kind of resource you want to display in the block: Items, Item Sets, or Media. 

Using the **Search query** element interface, select your subset of resources, or leave it blank.

Click the "Edit" button to reveal the advanced search interface in the drawer. Once you are satisfied with the subset of resources in your search, clicking the "Apply" button will set the subset of resources for the Browse block.

![Advanced search query drawer](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_query_search.png)

Once a query has been set, you can click "Edit" to update the universe of resources. You can click "Advanced Edit" to directly edit the query string. Finally, you can "Clear" a query to start over. If you have cleared a search in error, you can "Restore" it.

![Browse block with the edit query element](sitesfiles/sitepg_query_update.png)

The **Limit** field lets you set the number of resources to display in the block; any additional results from your query can be accessed on a search page linked from the block (you set the text of the link in the **Link text** field below).

The **Components** field lets you decide what to display in your browse for each resource: the Heading, the Body, and/or the Thumbnail. If not set in your [site settings](site_settings.md#browse), Heading defaults to resource title and Body to resource description.

The **Preview Title** field sets the heading above the browse section on the page.

The **Link text** field sets the link text at the bottom of the block - the block will only display as many results as you set in the **Limit** field above.

The Browse preview block has a template option in some themes. For example, the Foundation theme allows you to override the site settings for browsing with the options of displaying resources in a list or grid in this block. 

### HTML

Creates an HTML box in which you can add formatted text and links. When you click in the box, a formatting menu will display above the text field. 

Basic block: 

![Page block for HTML content](sitesfiles/sitepg_html.png)

With formatting menu open:

![Page block for HTML content with active field, showing formatting menu](sitesfiles/sitepg_html2.png)

You can embed content from elsewhere on the internet using iFrames or other embed codes in the HTML block. 

1. Click into the HTML block content area to show the formatting menu and then click on the button labeled "Source". ![HTML block with formatting menu open. A red arrow points to the Source button](sitesfiles/sitepg_htmlSource1.png)
2. This will open a dialog box where you can write HTML content.
3. Copy and paste the embed code into the source code editor. 
![Source box open with a short paragraph of text and an iframe from Vimeo](sitesfiles/sitepg_htmlSource2.png)
4. Click the green "OK" button at the bottom of the editor.
5. Your embed should show up in the HTML block either as a gray rectangle or as the embedded content. 
![HTML block showing the text and an embedded video](sitesfiles/sitepg_htmlSource3.png)

Finally, you can assign a **Class** to the HTML block for styling by your theme. If you do not assign a class, your HTML contents will show up without a wrapping `div` or other container. If you do assign a class, your HTML entry will appear inside a `<div class="[your class here]">` container. 

### Item showcase

A list of items. 

In item showcase blocks, multiple attachments build horizontally, creating rows across the page.

![Block for item showcase with one item added](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_showcase.png)

Using the drop-down menu in the block, you can:

- Set the thumbnail size for these items as large (default), medium, or square. 
- Set the attachment title as:
	- item title (title of the attached item);
	- media title (title of the specific piece of media you select associated with the item); or
	- no title.

Click the "Add Attachment" button to add an item to the block. This will open a drawer on the right side of the page to browse and select items.

If you have a large number of items to navigate, or multiple items with the same title, you can use the "Filter search" options by clicking the triangle button to the right of its label. 
 
These options are:

- Filter by class: opens a dropdown to select from all of the classes for the vocabularies in the Omeka S installation.
- Filter by item set: opens a dropdown to select from all item sets in the installation, not just those associated with the site on which you are working.
- Filter by item id: you can put in the specific item id for an item (the number which appears in the url when you are looking at the item on the admin). 

Once you have applied your changes to the filter, you must click the search button (magnifying glass) to apply the filters or run the search.

![Select item drawer with filter options displayed](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_selectitemFilter.png)

Once youâ€™ve selected an item, the drawer will shift to that itemâ€™s information. You can add a caption and select which media (if more than one) you want to use. To return to the list of items, click the "Select item" button at the top of the drawer. To use the item displayed and apply the caption, etc, click the "Apply changes" button at the bottom of the drawer.

![Item view with apply changes option](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_applyitem.png)

To add multiple items at once, click the "Quick add" slider just above the list of items in the right hand drawer. This will add a checkbox to the left of each item. Check the boxes of those items you want to add to the block, then click the "Add selected" button at the bottom of the drawer.

![Select item drawer with quick add activated - every item in the view now has a checkbox.](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_selectitemQuick.png)

To cancel the item selection, click the X in the upper right corner of the drawer at any time.

Once youâ€™ve added an item, it will appear in the Item List block. You can edit the caption or media options by clicking the edit (wrench) button for that row, and you can delete the item using the delete (trash can) icon.

You can add multiple items to the list.

### Item with metadata
This block displays an item along with all associated metadata (entered when creating or editing the [item](../content/items.md)).

Add attachments in the same manner as the [media embed](../sites/site_pages.md#media-embed) page block.

![Item with metadata block with nothing attached](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_iwm.png)

### Line break
Line break creates a transparent or opaque line break on the page, clearing all blocks. Select whether the line is transparent or opaque from the dropdown.

![line break table, dropdown selected to transparent](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_line.png)

HTML blocks wrap around Media blocks and at times you may want to clear the page. You might also want to create a visual break on the page. 

### List of pages
This block displays a linked list of pages. You may select from pages that are within the site but custom links such as Custom URL, Browse, and Browse Item Set are not available.

Clicking the "Add pages" button in the block, which will reveal a draw that contains all of the pages in the site. Click on the individual page to add it to the list.

![Page edit interface with List of pages block activated to open page select drawer](../sites/sitesfiles/sitespg_listPagesAdd.png)

You may drag and nest pages into any order.

![List of pages block with three pages showing nesting](../sites/sitesfiles/sitespg_listPagesOrder.png)

### List of sites
This block displays a list of all of the sites on your Omeka S install. This block has the following options:

- Sort sites by: Alphabetical order (A-Z); Oldest first; Newest first. By default this is set to alphabetical. 
- Max number of sites allows you to limit the number of sites which display at once. If left blank, all sites will display.
- A checkbox to turn on pagination; applied only if you set a display limit.
- A checkbox to show site summaries.  
- A checkbox to show site thumbnails.
- A checkbox to exclude the current site from the list. 

![List of sites block](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_slist1.png)

### Media embed
Creates a block with one or more pieces of media associated with items in the item pool. In media blocks, multiple attachments stack vertically.

![media block with no media attached](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_media.png)

The Media block has options for the display of the media: 

- Thumbnail type: choose from large, medium, and square.
- Thumbnail alignment: float left, float right, and center.
- Set the attachment title as:
	- item title (title of the attached item);
	- media title (title of the specific piece of media you select associated with the item); or
	- no title.

!!! note
	If you want media to appear beside a block of text, place a media block *above* an HTML block, select a smaller thumbnail size, and choose either float left or right for alignment. In the example below, the media has a thumbnail type of "medium", alignment "float right," and attachment title of the "item title": 

	![A block of lorem ipsum text with a right-aligned small image embedded at the top of the paragraph](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_mediaalign.png)

	Placing a media block *after* an HTML block will cause the media to appear below the end of the HTML block contents. 

To **add media to the block**, click the "Add attachment" button. 

On loading, the drawer will show a list of your items, most recent first. You can select from the first page, page through using the forward and back arrows, or search using the search bar. You can select from the first page, page through using the forward and back arrows, or search using the search bar. 

![Select item drawer](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_selectitem.png)
 
If you have a large number of items to navigate, or multiple items with the same title, you can use the "Filter search" options by clicking the triangle button to the right of its label. 
 
These options are:

- Filter by class: opens a dropdown to select from all of the classes for the vocabularies in the Omeka S installation.
- Filter by item set: opens a dropdown to select from all item sets in the installation, not just those associated with the site on which you are working.
- Filter by item id: you can put in the specific item id for an item (the number which appears in the url when you are looking at the item on the admin). 

Once you have applied your changes to the filter, you must click the search button (magnifying glass) to apply the filters or run the search.  

![Select item drawer with filter options displayed](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_selectitemFilter.png)

Once youâ€™ve selected an item, the drawer will shift to that itemâ€™s information. You can add a caption and select which media (if more than one) you want to use. To return to the list of items, click the "Select item" button at the top of the drawer. To use the item displayed and apply the caption, etc, click the "Apply changes" button at the bottom of the drawer.

![Item view with apply changes option](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_applyitem.png)

To add multiple items at once, click the "quick add" slider just above the list of items in the right hand drawer. This will add a checkbox to the left of each item. Check the boxes of those items you want to add to the block, then click the "Add selected" button at the bottom of the drawer.

![Select item drawer with quick add activated - every item in the view now has a checkbox.](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_selectitemQuick.png)

### Page date and time

Displays the first-created date and/or time, and/or last-modified date and/or time, for a given page. 

![Page date and time settings box with radio buttons.](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_pageDateTime.png)

You have the option of displaying the created, modified, or both dates, as well as formatting for dates and times. If you choose to display both date and time, it will appear with "at" between the two values:

```
<p>Page created: September 6, 2022 at 7:17:35 PM GMT</p>

<p>Page modified: September 7, 2022 at 9:38:39 PM GMT</p>
```

Date format options:

- None
- Short (`7/6/22`)
- Medium (`Sep 6, 2022`)
- Long (`September 6, 2022`)
- Full (`Tuesday, September 6, 2022`).

Time format options:

- None
- Short (`7:17 PM`)
- Medium (`7:17:35 PM`)
- Long (`7:17:35 PM GMT`)
- Full (`7:17:35 PM GMT`).

### Page title
Displays the title of the current page.

![Page block display site's title](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_title.png)

### Table of contents
If the current page has child pages, you can add a table of content block for those pages.

The Depth option allows you to set how many levels of child pages you want to display. If left blank, it will display all possible levels. Please enter a whole number.  

![Table of content block with no depth option set](../sites/sitesfiles/sitepg_toc.png)

Add and arrange pages using the [Site Navigation](../sites/site_navigation.md) settings. 

### Other blocks
For module-specific blocks, such as [Collecting](../modules/collecting.md) or [Mapping](../modules/mapping.md), see the documentation for that module.
